### Await, sync, callback and promises
#### 2018/10/07 3pm
#### Javascript promise is an important feature. It helps handle asynchronous request.
#### Therefore, I would like to write down the way I understand promises.

---

### *Await* and *Sync*
At first, Let me talk about the 2 keywords: await and sync


### Async functions

```Javascript
/* async keyword before a function means the function will always return a promise,
JavaScript automatically wraps it into a resolved promise with that value. */
async function f() {
  return 2018;
}

f().then(() => {
  console.log("The value returned by f() is" + value);
  // output: The value returned by f() is 2018
});

```
